# Jerry's Clueboard Layout

This is the default Clueboard layout with a Mac layout if F12 is used to
enter the boot menu within the first 15 seconds of powering on the keyboard.
Caps Lock and Ctrl are switched, media keys are added to the Fn layer, and
HHKB split backspace is used. Hold Caps Lock to configure RGB underlighting.
